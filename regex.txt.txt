[\w]+(?=\.)
//Captures words where a period immediately follows

(?=[A-Z]+[\w])(([\w]+(?=\.)))
//Using logical grouping, this does the same but only when there is a capital letter in the input 
//For some reason using the grouping is not working properly with the conditional or an operator, as it will not capture the final word as well. 


#2

[\w]+\.+.*
//captures the first word next to a period and every character following it
